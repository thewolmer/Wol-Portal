Customizing the CSS
If you want to customize the raw CSS generated by this plugin, add your overrides under the typography key in the theme section of your tailwind.config.js file:

````
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      typography: {
        DEFAULT: {
          css: {
            color: '#333',
            a: {
              color: '#3182ce',
              '&:hover': {
                color: '#2c5282',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    // ...
  ],
}```
````
